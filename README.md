Collection of Lua scripts for OpenTX.

## HeliStat

Full screen widget for the Radiomaster TX16S showing four switches and their meaning
when used with my ALZRC X360 helicopter.

Copy the HeliStat directory into the /WIDGET directory on the TX16S SD card.

## XLVoltage

Widget presenting the "RxBt" telemetry value using the largest font available. This
is the voltage of the LiPo when using Crossfire. The purpose of the widget is to
be able to read the voltage without reading glasses.

Copy the XLVoltage directory into the /WIDGET directory on the TX16S SD card.
